Continuous feedback or in other words -- reinforcement from a physics simulation could provide a superior signal
relative to just building world models using unsupervised learning.

Certainly where this is possible is only with simulation, so it may not be tenable for the sake of generality.

Question: Is conventional software, Ansys, etc, adequate for the dataset size I require?

Answer: No

Solution: Using a python package of some kind.
