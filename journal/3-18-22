The correct framework has been identified: https://github.com/peterdsharpe/AeroSandbox

What comes next is clear to understand.

1. Complete a complete literature review and furnish at least 20 papers on dynamical systems and VAE.
2. Based upon this background examination use the above framework to construct a series of bounded experiments.
3. Run experimental data through VAE and use it to construct a representative latent space.

I speculate an appropriate latent result will require more than reconstruction loss... indeed I suspect this will
require something particular and explicit about the quality of the symbolic reconstruction itself, but this will have
to be examined first hand.

I have begun to speculate on the exact drafting of my master's thesis, but I believe this will not be as complicated
as you might imagine. I propose to examine 3 separate physical systems:

1. A wing cross-section.
2. A pendulum.
3. Orbits.

There is no reason I cannot begin the working on the related work section today and begin precisely parameterizing the
experiments by next week.
