# Thesis
AI/Robotics thesis project at CU Boulder studying the relationship between dynamical systems and latent space
representations.

## Premise
Dynamical systems are used to describe time dependence of entities within ambient space.

Defining their operation is a costly process which requires human involvement.

We seek to define their behavior by translating time series data describing their operation into their governing
dynamics.

## Background
Latent space representation remains an underappreciated area of deep learning research. However, recent developments in
state representation learning and geometric machine learning have introduced new techniques to subsymbolic
representations.

Dynamical systems are an extremely rich and vast field with endless examples in everything from simple newtonian physics
to new advances in experimental physics. As this project is exploratory in nature and is done in support of the 
autonomous systems group at CU Boulder, I will be emphasizing systems which can be completely described by visual
inspection, and depend on basic newtonian mechanics.
